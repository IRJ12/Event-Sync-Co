# Event-Sync-Co
## Theme Chosen - Clubs and Events
- This theme stood out from the others because efficient connection between educational institutes and their students is integral. 
## Project Idea
An app based on events happening in educational institutions. The start page has the list of schools which leads to the admin, student or teacher page. The availabe features are: 
- Admin has access to change all events from all schools.
- Teachers are allowed to make changes only to school data.
- Students are only allowed to view the schedule of events and upload assignments and tests to the app.
- Once logged in to one of these profiles, a page with events, home and event calendar:
- The event page describes the event and gives the registration details and contact information if required.
- The home page has information about the school and its goals and aim.
- The event calendar shows the schedule of events for the year as updated by the school.
## What makes our project unique?
- There is a virtual representation of how the event is supposed to look like.
